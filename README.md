# q_learning
This is a simple project where the Q learning algorithm was applied to the classic taxi cab problem in reinforcement learning. It's dedicated to Satwik and Brendan's article on this subject, named "Reinforcement Q Learning from scratch in Python with OpenAI Gym" (https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/).
